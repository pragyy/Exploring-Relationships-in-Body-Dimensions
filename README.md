## About the Dataset

This dataset contains 21 body dimension measurements as well as age, weight, height, and gender on 507 individuals. The 247 men and 260 women were primarily individuals in their twenties and thirties, with a scattering of older men and women, all exercising several hours a week.

#### Data Source:

Measurements were initially taken by the first two authors - Grete Heinz and Louis J. Peterson - at San Jose State University and at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. Later, measurements were taken at dozens of California health and fitness clubs by technicians under the supervision of one of these authors.

#### Data Columns:

**Skeletal Measurements:**

Biacromial diameter (see Fig. 2) 
Biiliac diameter, or "pelvic breadth" (see Fig. 2)
Bitrochanteric diameter (see Fig. 2)
Chest depth between spine and sternum at nipple level, mid-expiration
Chest diameter at nipple level, mid-expiration
Elbow diameter, sum of two elbows
Wrist diameter, sum of two wrists
Knee diameter, sum of two knees
Ankle diameter, sum of two ankles

**Girth Measurements:**

Shoulder girth over deltoid muscles
Chest girth, nipple line in males and just above breast tissue in females, mid-expiration
Waist girth, narrowest part of torso below the rib cage,average of contracted and relaxed position
Navel (or "Abdominal") girth at umbilicus and iliac crest, iliac crest as a landmark
Hip girth at level of bitrochanteric diameter
Thigh girth below gluteal fold, average of right and left girths
Bicep girth, flexed, average of right and left girths
Forearm girth, extended, palm up, average of right and left girths
Knee girth over patella, slightly flexed position, average of right and left girths
Calf maximum girth, average of right and left girths
Ankle minimum girth, average of right and left girths
Wrist minimum girth, average of right and left girths

**Other Measurements:**

Age (years)
Weight (kg)
Height (cm)
Gender (1 - male, 0 - female)

The first 21 variables are all measured in centimeters (cm).

There are no missing values.
